# Bear to Dropbox Paper Migration Tool

I really liked Bear, but I also sometimes need to access notes on other
computers.  This tool will migrate exported Bear (markdown format)
notes into Paper.

## Instructions

First, you'll need to get a Dropbox access token:

1. Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create.
    a. Select "Dropbox API" as your API selection.
    b. Select "Full Dropbox" as the access level.
    c. Enter a name for your new app -- I chose "Bear to Paper".
2. You'll then be shown the app configuration page.
    a. Click "Generate access token"
    b. Save this token somewhere.
